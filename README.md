Handwritten Digit Classification Project
By: Aaron Upchurch

Purpose: To employ mahcine learning algorithms for the recognition of handwritten numerical digits

Instructions:
  1. Run Drawing.exe
  2. Run ClassificationAlgorithm.py
  3. Wait for python code to prompt for input
  4. Use the left mouse button to draw a digit through the Drawing.exe window
  5. Click the red button to erase the drawing
  6. Once finished, click the clue button to save the image
  7. Input 'y' to the python terminal
  8. Examine classification output

Specifications:

  The algorithm implements a k nearest neightbor learning algorithm based on 60,000 labled samples
  from the MNIST handwritten digit dataset
  
  The euclidian distance between two images is defined as the square root of the sum of all squared differences
  between each pixel color in both images
  
  Pixel colors where (0,255)
  
  Limited testing of the classification algorithm has revealed a correct response rate of ~90%
